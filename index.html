		Lana Del Rey is often celebrated for her melancholic and nostalgic portrayal of the American Dream. Her music and lyrics frequently explore themes of love, loss, and the pursuit of happiness within the context of American culture. Del Rey’s work is deeply infused with a sense of longing and a critical view of the idealized American lifestyle.

		In her debut album, Born to Die, Del Rey paints a picture of a glamorous yet troubled life, filled with references to classic Americana. Songs like “National Anthem” and “Video Games” juxtapose the allure of fame and wealth with the emptiness that often accompanies it. Her lyrics often reflect a yearning for a simpler, more authentic existence, while simultaneously acknowledging the seductive pull of material success.

		Del Rey’s subsequent albums, such as Ultraviolence and Honeymoon, continue to delve into the darker side of the American Dream. In Ultraviolence, she moves away from suburban imagery to explore the gritty realities of urban life. Tracks like “Brooklyn Baby” and “West Coast” highlight the disillusionment and decay that can lie beneath the surface of the American ideal1.

		Her album Norman Fucking Rockwell! is perhaps the most explicit in its critique of American culture. The title itself references the famous American painter known for his idealized depictions of American life. Through songs like “Mariners Apartment Complex” and “Venice Bitch,” Del Rey examines the contradictions and complexities of modern America, blending personal introspection with broader social commentary</a>.

		Overall, Lana Del Rey’s music serves as a poignant exploration of the American Dream, capturing both its allure and its inherent flaws. Her melancholic style and evocative lyrics offer a unique perspective on what it means to chase and live the American Dream in the contemporary world.
